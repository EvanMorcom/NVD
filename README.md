# Capturing Body Motion in 3D

Track a person in the physical environment and visualize their motion by applying the same body movements to a virtual character.  

## Overview

- Note: This sample code project is associated with WWDC 2019 session [607: Bringing People into AR](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc19/607/).

## Next Steps

- Replace robot character with simple skeleton to visualize motion

- Implement record functionality to track, save, and playback a specific motion

- Add UI to display analytics for recorded motion
